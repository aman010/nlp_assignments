* The search query is simple sentence tries to find the context there two model implemented Glove and skipGram (neg Word2vec)
* The major function of the search query is limited to perform only search based on the key words and provied the relation and the context 
* for example 'good veg food' the relationship tries to find ["good","veg","sauerkraut"] 
* The current limitation to the work is since we kept window size small as per the  computational limitation some the words make more preference since they occure more frequently
* second is it does not perfom document search
